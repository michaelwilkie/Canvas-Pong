This is pong. I have finished all I wanted to finish with this little app.

As of 2/20/2019 it is finished.

Difficulties:
    Creating animations from scratch proved to be challenging to implement.
    Thankfully, Microsoft Paint's minimalistic capabilities did not
    hinder my artistry.

    Adding sound was an easy addition but trying to work around it is difficult.
    So I stuck with the current system I have now where sounds are queued
    instead of playing at any collision.
